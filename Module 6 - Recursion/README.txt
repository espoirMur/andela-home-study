Module 6 - Recursion

Overview

Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. We have seen that functions are named procedures which perform distinct tasks or services. This module will address recursion as a technique involving the use of functions.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to understand:

1) What recursion is about.
2) Types of recursion.
3) Recursive functions.
4) When to use recursive functions.
5) Advantages and disadvantages of recursion.
6) Difference between recursion and iteration.
7) How recursive functions in Python are written.
