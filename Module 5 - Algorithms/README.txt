Module 5 - Algorithms

Overview

Computer scientists learn by experience. We learn by seeing other people solve problems and by solving problems ourselves. Exposing us to different problem-solving techniques and seeing how algorithms are designed helps us take on challenging problems.

By the end of this module, you should be able to understand:

1) The principles of algorithms.
2) The importance of algorithms.
3) Algorithm analysis.
4) Algorithms and how they are implemented in Python.
